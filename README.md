## How to use it

Add the file `syntax.min.js` to the end of your code and it will automatically highlight every `<code>` tag that you have in your page.

The script will create `<spam>` tag for every reserved word, variable, methods and numbers so you can target them with CSS.

Fell free to change anything you like to better suit your needs.
